4\Litotes\It's the little things that make paronomasia so good. I scoff at those who call it the lowest form of comedy.

6\Method of Proof\My other favorite proof technique is claiming that things are trivial.
7\Programming Paradigms\I've tried them all: Java, Python,... . They're also non-functional.
8\Inspirational Quotes\I like to imagine that Confucius was a little tipsy when he said, "Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."

11\Floating Point Arithmetic\It's even worse when the numbers are in a different language.

13\Nothing\Yep, that's what he thought.
14\Army Recruitment\Oh, I can't join the army. It's not bone spurs; I'm just not good at Fortnite.
15\SAT Prep Program\They've been running this commercial since 2012.
16\Job Hunting\My resume has become a list of qualities that are either generic and open to interpretation, or soon to be developed. Fast learner? Not in my classes, but yeah, usually I am. Proactive? I will be by the time the interview comes.
17\Lemongame Theory\It's the exact same lemonade. My brother just claimed to be following FDA food labeling requirements.
18\Semantics\When you're in a high-pressure situation, either say the second statement or make sure you're not dealing with a logician.
19\Fallacy of Equivocation\In my defense, he wanted an example of a fallacy of equivocation. It's probably not right -- no, it's definitely not right to say that.

24\Magic of Proof\Just another day in my intro to proofs class.
25\Show Don't Tell\On second thought, I prefer you just telling me. I've also never liked show and tell.

34\How Torrenting Works\You get a completed homework file by asking people for answers. If you're allowed to ask for answers, then it's legal. If not, then it's illegal. If it's illegal and you ask the teacher for an answer, then you get a copyright violation notice. Here's the thing: it's practically impossible to know if the person you're asking is the teacher. The people asking for #8 and #10 are so screwed.

46\Newton's Method\The surface of the earth is concave down and his line of sight has a nonzero slope, but I feel like he's still gonna miss. What am I "missing" here?
47\Variable-Message Signs\It's a lot more foreboding to think that the message on variable-message signs are written by psychics. "Click it or ticket." "Report drunk drivers."
48\Thoughts\It's the thought that counts.
49\Compound Adjectives\This is why you hyphenate compound adjectives in front of the noun they're modifying - wait, open compounds? Now how am I supposed to know if you're talking about a high school teacher or a high school teacher?
50\Public Access\Package: PeopleInTheArea<br>Classes: Workers, Customers<br>It's a "protected" restroom! If the restroom was inside the building and not accessible to customers, then it would be "private".
