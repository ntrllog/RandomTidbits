3|Semantic Satiation|Now we know the boy actually cried, "wolf! wolf! wolf! wolf! wolf! wolf! wolf! wolf! wolf!"
4|Litotes|It's the little things that make paronomasia so good. I scoff at those who call it the lowest form of comedy.

11|Floating Point Arithmetic|It's even worse when the numbers are in a different language.

14|SAT Prep Program|They've been running this commercial since 2012.
15|Job Hunting|My resume has become a list of qualities that are either generic and open to interpretation, or soon to be developed. Fast learner? Not in my classes, but yeah, usually I am. Proactive? I will be by the time the interview comes.

17|Semantics|See? I told you the left statement is not an implication!

20|Birthplace|Wait, where I'm standing or where you're standing?

The people asking for #8 and #10 are so screwed.

42|Thoughts|It's the thought that counts.
43|Compound Adjectives|This is why you hyphenate compound adjectives in front of the noun they're modifying - wait, open compounds? Now how am I supposed to know if you're talking about a high school teacher or a high school teacher?
