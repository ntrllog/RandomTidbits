1|Hi, My Name Is|chka-chka, Slim Shady.
2|Adjectives|Oh sure. You don't understand that, but you understand "big bad wolf?!"
3|Semantic Satiation|Now we know the boy actually cried, "wolf! wolf! wolf! wolf! wolf! wolf! wolf! wolf! wolf!"
4|Litotes|It's the little things that make paronomasia so good. I scoff at those who call it the lowest form of comedy.
5|IDK|I also claim that the identity in k is equal to "idk". Since k is commutative, I "kid" you not.
6|Method of Proof|My other favorite proof technique is claiming that things are trivial.
7|Programming Paradigms|I've tried them all: Java, Python,... . They're also non-functional.
8|Inspirational Quotes|I like to imagine that Confucius was a little tipsy when he said, "Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."
9|Universal Word|Look at you, overcoming language barriers! But you still don't know how it's going.
10|Floating Point Arithmetic|It's even worse when the numbers are in a different language.
11|Grammarly|This is a case of writing a compiler for a compiler. Huh, imagine if there was a math equivalent, like a function that checks if something is a function.
12|Nothing|Yep, that's what he thought.
13|SAT Prep Program|They've been running this commercial since 2012.|Max score changed from 2400 to 1600 in 2018
14|Job Hunting|My resume has become a list of qualities that are either generic and open to interpretation, or soon to be developed. Fast learner? Not in my classes, but yeah, usually I am. Proactive? I will be by the time the interview comes.
15|Lemongame Theory|It's the exact same lemonade. My brother just claimed to be following FDA food labeling requirements.
16|Semantics|See? I told you the left statement is not an implication!
17|Fallacy of Equivocation|In my defense, he wanted an example of a fallacy of equivocation. It's probably not right -- no, it's definitely not right to say that.
18|Antimetabolism|I sure do! I am what I eat and I eat what I -- oh no.|antimetabole
19|Birthplace|Wait, where I'm standing or where you're standing?
20|Magic of Proof|Just another day in my intro to proofs class.
21|Show Don't Tell|On second thought, I prefer you just telling me. I've also never liked show and tell.
22|Compilation Errors|Altruistic reason: They wanted to scare us into not making errors in our code.<br>Sadistic reason: Same, but they wanted us to make more runtime and logic errors.
23|PEMDAS|719 tries later, someone's dear Aunt Sally arrived.
24|Statistics Conclusions|According to a peer-reviewed study, low original risk, correlation-implies-causation evidence, and a high margin of error play a big part in our study. That's where the 5% went.
25|Math vs. Computer Science|Old-school writers are asking computer programmers to write a program to look for their Oxford commas. Turns out the mathematicians have been taking them.
26|How Snapchat Works|Apparently, the Android app takes a screenshot of the camera feed instead of using the actual camera hardware.
27|Phone-DoS|The legal way to DDoS if handling phone calls was asynchronous.
28|How Torrenting Works|You get a completed homework file by asking people for answers. If you're allowed to ask for answers, then it's legal. If not, then it's illegal. If it's illegal and you ask the teacher for an answer, then you get a copyright violation notice. Here's the thing: it's practically impossible to know if the person you're asking is the teacher. The people asking for #8 and #10 are so screwed.
29|WTS|I also don't signal when I'm about to make a turn or change lanes. I know where I'm going.
30|Operator Precedence|Some people might be surprised when they get just salad instead of rice with salad.
31|Subject-Verb Agreement|I feel like whoever came up with the rules of subject-verb agreement just wanted to prevent dumb conversations like this.
32|Induction|If it works for n, it will work for n+1.
33|Contained Oxymorons|and all words prefixed by "a", "de", "dis", "il", "im", "in", "ir", "mis", "non", "un".
34|That's an x|Circular reasoning, infinite loops, and recursion were inspired by bad handwriting.
35|Rate of Selling|Maggie made $0 that day.
36|Regression to You're Mean|I'll take "Bad Responses to a Poor Performance" for $600.
37|Lay|Poor guy just wanted to write a linear algebra textbook before he got caught in this mess.
38|Genius|I can't tell if this is "in, on, or not" genius. Or just dumb.
39|Variable-Message Signs|It's a lot more foreboding to think that the message on variable-message signs are written by psychics. "Click it or ticket." "Report drunk drivers."
40|Thoughts|It's the thought that counts.
41|Compound Adjectives|This is why you hyphenate compound adjectives in front of the noun they're modifying - wait, open compounds? Now how am I supposed to know if you're talking about a high school teacher or a high school teacher?
42|Public Access|Package: PeopleInTheArea<br>Classes: Workers, Customers<br>It's a "protected" restroom! If the restroom was inside the building and not accessible to customers, then it would be "private".
43|Rhetorical Devices Part 1|I find chiasmus a bit overrated and overused. I'm also having a hard time coming up with one for yo mama.
44|Rhetorical Devices Part 2|Yo mama's so fat, she wanted more.
45|Quasi Pseudo|Two guys walk into a bar and tell a bad joke.
46|Butterfly Effect|For a news station in Brazil, we sure had a lot of information about Texas.
47|Manifolds|No, your child isn't dumb. He's just a precocious topologist.
48|Christmas Song Dedication|&#9834; Last Christmas, I gave you my heart... &#9834;
49|Brand Advertising|I prefer to see this as an admission that they're not the leading brand.
50|Wheel of Fortune|I think he got what he asked for.
51|The Halting Trolley Problem|Yeah, the name sounds perfect for it, but applying the halting problem to the trolley problem doesn't completely solve it. It might even create a worse moral dilemma.
52|Negation Attempt|You are so cucking wrong.
53|Dating App Code|Instead of fixing the bug, we decided to publish some stats about our user base instead.
54|Race Condition|They say doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results is insanity. Well, trying to reproduce this race condition is "driving" me insane.
55|Math vs. Computer Science Part 2|Oh, yeah? You guys somehow have an irrational number raised to an imaginary number turning into an integer.|Euler's Identity
56|Transformation|I finally found a use for the 9th root transformation
57|Or Else|I present to you the "or-else" construct, where you can have the best of both branches! You better learn how to use it... or else...
